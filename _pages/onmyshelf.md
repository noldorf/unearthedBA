I love to read. I think it is the best way to learn new things, broaden your perspective and I also get most of my inspiration from books. That's why I want to share with you my favorite books here. 



## Inspired - How to Create Tech Products Customer Love
##### by Marty Cagan

The title delivers what it promises. Many topic are discussed, how successfull companies create and release products to their customer.
Some people call this book the "bible" if you are starting as a Business Analyst, Product Owner or Product Manager and I fully agree. First I read the whole book to get an overview. And now, I reread different chapters when I deal with a certain topic.

## Sprint - How to Solve Big Problems and Test new Ideas in just 5 Days
###### by Jake Knapp, John Zeratsky & Braden Kowitz
Sprint is a quick and easy read. For me it was pure inspiration and I'm looking forward to actually try out this technique. The whole process of finding the most important problem you should investigate as a company, creating ideas how to solve the problem and how you can quickly test them is described on a day-to-day basis. It provides a step by step guide with detailed explanations.

## Accelerate
###### by Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble and  Gene Kim
I studied Physics, which means scientific approaches attract me magically. This book presents the findings of a study about the measurement of software delivery performance and  the difference between high, medium and low performing companies (e.g. lead time, deployment frequency, MTTR, Change Fail Percentage). Although the insights can be quite technical it shows the scientific proof for everything you can read in general books on how to create products.

## Reinventing Organizations: An Illustrated Invitation to Join the Conversation on Next-Stage Organizations
###### Frederic Laloux
If you are interested in organisational change, transformation process or want to get more insights on the topic  New Work, this is your book. I especially liked the illustrated version, because the effect of the statements is further enhanced by the pictures. It explains nicely how organisational change also happens naturally and what you as employee could do. For me as a consultant it helped me get fresh ideas how a company could manage itself.

## Lean Inception
###### Paulo Caroli

Lean Inception is practically the next step after you decided on what to build next with an existing team or want to start a new product team. It's kind of the step after the process described in "Sprint". As a BA I often help teams to start with a new product or feature. The book shows a nice schedule how to align on different aspects (Business, Design, Tech) in just one weeks and gives also recommendations on methods (e.g. how to create an empathy map) that could be used. I used this process already several times successfully during the last years.

## Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men
###### Caroline Criado Perez 
This book is eye-opening. Especially as a Product Manager if you want to decide based on data which feature should be implement next this should be a must read just to raise awareness.

## Rising Strong
###### Brené Brown
After I watched [Brené Brown’s Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_the_power_of_vulnerability) about vulnerability I read the whole book series (“The gift of imperfection”, “Daring Greatly”, “Rising Strong”, “Dare to Lead”). I could recommend every single one of them but “Rising Strong” is by far my favorite because it gives hands on activities how to overcome failing and rise again. It actually helped to built up better team spirits because you understand what is needed to build trust and encourage to try new things.

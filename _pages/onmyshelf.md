I love to read. I think it is the best way to learn new things, broaden your perspective and I also get most of my inspiration from books. That's why I want to share with you my favorite books here. 



# Inspired - How to Create Tech Products Customer Love
### by Marty Cagan

The title delivers what it promises. Many topic are discussed, how successfull companies create and release products to their customer.
Some people call this book the "bible" if you are starting as a Business Analyst, Product Owner or Product Manager and I fully agree. First I read the whole book to get an overview. And now, I reread different chapters when I deal with a certain topic.

### Hello, my name is Nadine Oldorf!

I'm a Senior Business Analyst Consultant working at the moment for [ThoughtWorks](https://www.thoughtworks.com/) in Hamburg, Germany and I'm passionate about solving problems, creating products with our clients and establish an open and honest work atmosphere.
 
 But let's start at the beginning. So I studied Physics and after my PhD I wanted to start a new adventure which brought me as a Graduate QA to ThoughtWorks. I had no idea how modern software development looks like, what a QA actually does. But I joined team and got to know people teaching me everything I need know.
 
 On of my core strengths according to the [Gallup Strength Finder](https://www.amazon.com/StrengthsFinder-2-0-Tom-Rath/dp/159562015X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=NSE4JJ50V46F&keywords=gallup+strengths+finder+2.0+with+access+code&qid=1582837613&sprefix=gallup+%2Caps%2C229&sr=8-1) is Learner, which means I love to learn new skills and jumping into the unknown. So starting in a position I had only a vague idea about was my dream job.
 But after some time I realised what I enjoyed most having difficult conversations with our stakeholder and talking to our users about their needs regarding the product we wanted to built. Thus, I changed my role.
 
 At the moment I consider myself a Generalist - BA, PO, PM,... whatever abbreviation you want to use as long it relates to people and solving their problems with meaningful products.
 
 Outside of work I enjoy reading, listening to podcasts and every single minute with by child. In addition, I'm always looking for new challenges like starting a blog and getting out of my comfort zone.

Escaping the Build Trap by Melissa Perry is a wonderful book for all those who want to move towards product management and learn the interplay between the role of product manager, strategy and the analysis process. In addition, there is a chapter on how the organization itself often gets in the way of working product-oriented by living inappropriate processes for budgets and bonuses.

My favorite quote (swipe left) is already on page 43 and reflects for me the basic problem. Many companies want to become agile, but by that they mean the introduction of Scrum in the IT department and forget that the processes in business analysis must also change.

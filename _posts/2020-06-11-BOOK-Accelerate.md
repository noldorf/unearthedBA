I studied Physics, which means scientific approaches attract me magically. This book presents the findings of a study about the measurement of software delivery performance and  the difference between high, medium and low performing companies (e.g. lead time, deployment frequency, MTTR, Change Fail Percentage). Although the insights can be quite technical it shows the scientific proof for everything you can read in general books on how to create products.

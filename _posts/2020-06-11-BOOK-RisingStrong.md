After I watched [Brené Brown’s Ted Talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/brene_brown_the_power_of_vulnerability) about vulnerability I read the whole book series (“The gift of imperfection”, “Daring Greatly”, “Rising Strong”, “Dare to Lead”). I could recommend every single one of them but “Rising Strong” is by far my favorite because it gives hands on activities how to overcome failing and rise again. It actually helped to built up better team spirits because you understand what is needed to build trust and encourage to try new things.

[Buy this book](https://www.amazon.com/-/de/Rising-Strong-Ability-Transforms-Parent/dp/081298580X/ref=sr_1_5?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&dchild=1&keywords=brene+brown&qid=1591641857&sr=8-5)

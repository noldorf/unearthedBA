I have thought for a long time about which topic I would like to write about first on this blog. Some topics seemed too big for me to write about, so that I didn't even get into writing and others were too null and void to be mentioned at all - I will write about them anyway.  If they keep me busy, maybe others will think about them, too. 

At the end of my spiral of thoughts I have now landed at the topic self-promotion.  In this article I would like to talk about why it is difficult for us to promote ourselves, why it is so incredibly important and why we should stop listening to that voice in our head that is trying to convince us that we are not good enough.

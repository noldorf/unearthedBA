The title delivers what it promises. Many topic are discussed, how successful companies create and release products to their customer.
Some people call this book the "bible" if you are starting as a Business Analyst, Product Owner or Product Manager and I fully agree. First I read the whole book to get an overview. And now, I reread different chapters when I deal with a certain topic.
